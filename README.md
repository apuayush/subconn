## SubConn
A Progressive Web App to track subsidized product transactions using distributed ledgers, hence improving efficiency and transparency in the distribution of goods and services through various Govt. schemes.

The algorithm includes a unique forward pass that integrates the tokens with the blockchain to allow for a back propagation to detect and handle errors. The block chain secures the item transactions and maintains the path followed by each item

### Solution
 - Tracking the products from the supplier to the consumer through the chain.
 - Eliminate tampering by middlemen.
 - Maintain quality control of the goods.

### Tools and Platforms
 - [x] Tagging each item using a QR Code

 - [x] Secure and open database using NoSQL and Blockchain to prevent any tampering.
 - [ ] Aadhar API to validate and verify the agents and consumers.

### Results
 - [x] Reduce losses to 10%
 - [x] Prevent theft by middlemen.
